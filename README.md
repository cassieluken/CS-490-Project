This is our final version we submitted but there are still improvements that can be made. 
This is just the front-end code. 
NOTE: Whenever there is a textarea there were difficulties inserting using SQL if the text had ' (apostrophe). For example, if you write doesn't the SQL insert statement would break but if you write does not it works. 
Similarly, for the input testcase in makequestion.php it is important to construct the input as it would in a function call.
For example, operation("+", 2, 3) the input would be "+", 2, 3   (Again, do not use single quotes, "" must be used)
ENJOY!
